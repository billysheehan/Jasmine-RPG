This project was a difficult one to master - I believe there is room for improvement, but more or less, I was able to get it working correctly.
I ran into trouble with the timer and the functions that made the countdown. I was still unable to get the quiz to wrap up nicely by stopping once the timer reached zero.
I was unsure of how to link more than the pages provided, or what made sense with the CSS.
